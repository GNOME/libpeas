/**
 * PeasExtension:
 *
 * #PeasExtension is a proxy class used to access actual extensions implemented
 * using various languages.
 *
 * As such, the application writer will use #PeasExtension instances to call
 * methods on extension provided by loaded plugins.
 *
 * To properly use the proxy instances, you will need GObject-introspection
 * data for the [alias@GObject.Type] you want to use as an extension point.
 * For instance, if you wish to use [iface@Activatable], you will need to
 * put the following code excerpt in the engine initialization code, in order
 * to load the required "Peas" typelib:
 *
 * ```c
 * g_irepository_require (g_irepository_get_default (),
 *                        "Peas", "1.0", 0, NULL);
 * ```
 *
 * You should proceed the same way for any namespace which provides types
 * you want to use as extension points. GObject-introspection data is required
 * for all the supported languages, even for C.
 *
 * #PeasExtension does not provide any way to access the underlying object.
 * The main reason is that some loaders may not rely on proper GObject
 * inheritance for the definition of extensions, and hence it would not be
 * possible for libpeas to provide a functional GObject instance at all.
 * Another reason is that it makes reference counting issues easier to deal
 * with.
